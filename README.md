# Image-color-detector
An application to detect specific colors in an image with GUI.

The application allows you to perform several operations.

It has been divided into two segments. 

The first - RGB - allows you to search for colors by specifying each component (red, green, blue) separately.
The user adjusts the gray level of each color with the sliders.
The scale of the sliders is from 0 to 255.

The first - HSV - allows you to search for colors by specifying each component (hue, saturation, value) separately.
Familiarize yourself with the HSV model in order to use this segment properly.
The scale of the sliders is from 0 to 1.
For hue, a scale of 0 to 1 corresponds to a palette of 0 to 360 degrees.

You can edit the size of the smallest detectable elements and the size of the morphological closing in both segments.
